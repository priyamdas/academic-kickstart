I am a cognitive scientist and recent grad eager to apply my research expertise to products and solutions that help people achieve their goals. During my PhD, I focused on understanding what learning looks like during old age and conducted multiple online behavioral experiments to study this process. Previously, I worked on developing a cognitive tutor to teach people how to plan better. Outside of research, I like to bake desserts and study foreign languages. My professional goal is to have a career in research, while my life goal is to continue learning new languages even when I'm well in my eighties.
